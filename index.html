    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Frequent-Flyer Miles Card?</h2>
      <p>A frequent-flyer miles credit card is a card tied to one airline’s loyalty program. Instead of earning cashback, you collect airline miles — earned through both spending and flights — which can be redeemed for award tickets, upgrades or partner flights.</p>
      <p>Frequent-flyer cards often provide the most value for travellers who fly regularly — especially on long-haul or premium-class flights. Their usefulness depends heavily on how the airline’s network and partners match your travel patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning Mechanics -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Spending and Flights Earn Miles</h2>
      <p>Everyday spending on the card earns a base rate of miles; many cards also offer bonus miles in categories like travel, dining or foreign transactions. Flights booked with the airline or its partners also earn miles — sometimes enhanced when booking premium fare classes or during promotions.</p>
      <p>Welcome bonuses or spend-based bonuses are common for mileage cards. Meeting a spend threshold or flying a certain number of miles in a period can significantly jump-start your mileage balance, making premium redemptions possible much sooner.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles — Flights, Upgrades & Flexibility</h2>
      <p>Miles can typically be redeemed for award flights, seat upgrades or partner airline tickets. The number of miles required depends on destination, travel class, date (peak vs off-peak) and availability. Premium-cabin and long-distance flights often provide the highest value per mile.</p>
      <p>However, award availability, blackout dates, fuel surcharges or carrier-imposed fees may reduce the net value of a miles redemption compared with paying cash. Flexibility and planning ahead often yield the best returns.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Partners & Network -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Partner Airlines & Alliances Matter</h2>
      <p>A major strength of programs like LifeMiles is their network of partner airlines. That allows you to redeem miles across multiple carriers when your own airline doesn’t fly your desired route — increasing flexibility and benefit for global travellers.</p>
      <p>When using partners, award charts and fees might differ. Always compare total cost — miles required plus taxes and fees — before finalising a booking.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & Suitability</section>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When a Miles Card Is Worth It — and When It’s Not</h2>
      <p>If you fly regularly — especially on long-haul, international or premium-class flights — a frequent-flyer miles card can offer substantial value. Miles redemptions can pay off if used strategically and ahead of time.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you rarely fly or mostly use low-cost carriers, a flexible travel-rewards card or cashback card can be more predictable. Frequent-flyer miles cards require matching habits to network reach to truly shine.</p>
