    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is an Airline Mileage Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        An airline mileage credit card is co-branded with a specific frequent-flyer program. Instead of earning generic
        points or cashback, you earn miles that sit directly in a loyalty account and follow that program’s rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        These miles can usually be redeemed on the main airline and on partner carriers within an alliance or partnership
        network, opening up more routes and cabins than a single airline alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mileage cards are typically most valuable for travelers who fly at least a few times per year and are willing
        to learn basic redemption strategies to avoid poor-value options.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- EARNING -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How You Earn Miles on a Mileage Card</h2>
      <p>Most airline cards earn miles through a mix of:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li><strong>Base earn</strong> – a fixed number of miles per unit of spend, often 1×–2× on everyday purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus categories</strong> – higher earn on airfare, hotels, dining or other partner categories.</li>
        <li><strong>Welcome bonuses</strong> – large mile bonuses if you reach a minimum spend in the first few months.</li>
        <li><strong>Flight activity</strong> – extra miles and sometimes elite-qualifying credit when you actually fly.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner activity</strong> – car rentals, hotels and shopping portals that credit miles to the same account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because miles land directly with the airline program, they often stack with miles earned from flights themselves,
        accelerating your balance if you are an active traveler.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- REDEEMING -->
    <section id="redeeming" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles – Where Value Comes From</h2>
      <p>
        Airline miles do not have a fixed cash value. Instead, you look at how many miles plus taxes and fees are required
        for a ticket, then compare that to the cash price.
      </p>
      <p>Key drivers of redemption value include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li><strong>Cabin class</strong> – business and first class often deliver the highest cents-per-mile value.</li>
        <li><strong>Route and season</strong> – long-haul and peak-season flights can give outsized value.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner availability</strong> – alliances and partners expand where you can actually fly using miles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash surcharges</strong> – fuel surcharges and fees can erode the value of an award ticket.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some programs also offer “mixed-cabin” or “mixed-partner” itineraries where you combine different airlines on a
        single award, which can unlock routes that are expensive with cash.
      </p>

    <!-- WHEN IT MAKES SENSE -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When Mileage Cards Are a Good Fit</h2>
      <p>Airline mileage cards are often worth considering if:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li>You fly long-haul or internationally at least once or twice a year.</li>
        <li>You are willing to be flexible with dates and routes to find good award availability.</li>
        <li>You are comfortable paying an annual fee in exchange for perks and higher earn rates.</li>
        <li>You use the same airline group or alliance often enough to actually redeem large awards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your travel is rare or heavily domestic on many different carriers, a simple bank-points or cashback card may
        be easier to use than a tightly structured mileage program.
